# Blog Card Display Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The blog cards on the Evolve Acoustics website were experiencing several display issues:
1. Images not showing properly in blog cards
2. Text breaking awkwardly across multiple lines
3. Cards showing inconsistent heights
4. Error loops appearing in the browser console

## Root Cause
The issues were caused by conflicting JavaScript files that were trying to manipulate the blog card display:
- `visual-issue-detector.js` - Attempting to fix visual issues but causing conflicts
- `blog-text-fix.js` - Trying to fix text display but creating conflicts
- `evolve-visual-fixes.js` - Applying visual fixes but conflicting with CSS

## Solution Implemented
We removed the problematic JavaScript files from:
1. Main blog page: `/home/bkam/evolve-acoustics/pages/blog.html`
2. Blog post template: `/home/bkam/evolve-acoustics/templates/blog-post-template.html`
3. All individual blog post pages in `/home/bkam/evolve-acoustics/pages/blogs/`

The existing CSS in `blog.css` already had proper styling for blog cards with:
- Fixed heights for card elements
- Proper image display properties
- Text overflow handling with ellipsis
- Line clamping for consistent text display

## Files Modified
1. **Main Blog Page**:
   - Removed `blog-text-fix.js`
   - Removed `evolve-visual-fixes.js`
   - Removed `visual-issue-detector.js`
   - Kept `image-optimization.js` as it's still needed

2. **Blog Post Template**:
   - Removed `evolve-visual-fixes.js`
   - Removed `visual-issue-detector.js`
   - Redirected path for `image-optimization.js`

3. **Individual Blog Posts** (10 files):
   - Removed `evolve-visual-fixes.js`
   - Removed `visual-issue-detector.js`
   - Kept `image-optimization.js` as it's still needed

## Verification
A verification script `verify-blog-card-display.js` was created to check:
- Card height consistency
- Image loading and visibility
- Proper text truncation

To run the verification:
1. Execute `./add-verification-script.sh` to add the verification script to the blog page
2. Open the blog page in a browser
3. Check the browser console for verification results

## Expected Results
- Blog cards should now display with consistent heights
- Images should load and display properly
- Text should be properly truncated with ellipsis
- No JavaScript errors in the console

The solution leverages the existing CSS rules in `blog.css`, which already had proper styling but was being overridden by the problematic JavaScript files.
