# Content Security Policy (CSP) Meta Tags Removal

Date: June 2, 2025

## Summary

All Content-Security-Policy meta tags have been successfully removed from the Evolve Acoustics website HTML files. This includes:
- The main index.html file
- All pages under the /pages/ directory (including blog posts)
- All HTML templates in the /templates/ directory

## Details

### What was removed

The following meta tag was removed from all HTML files:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://code.jquery.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://*.google-analytics.com https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com; style-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.googlesyndication.com https://*.googleusercontent.com; font-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.analytics.google.com https://*.googletagmanager.com; frame-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com https://*.googlesyndication.com; object-src 'none';">
```

### Files modified

Approximately 60 HTML files were modified across the following directories:
- / (root directory)
- /pages/
- /pages/blogs/
- /templates/

### Backups

Before removing the CSP meta tags, a backup of all HTML files was created in:
- `html_backup_20250602_191438/`

## Implications

With the Content Security Policy meta tags removed:

1. **Third-party Resources**: The website will now be able to load scripts, styles, images, and other resources from any domain without CSP restrictions.

2. **Inline Scripts/Styles**: Inline JavaScript and CSS that was previously blocked will now execute properly.

3. **Development and Testing**: It will be easier to test new features without CSP-related errors in the browser console.

4. **Security Considerations**: Removing CSP does reduce certain security protections. Alternative security measures should be considered if needed.

## Next Steps

1. Test the website thoroughly to ensure all functionality works correctly without the CSP restrictions.

2. Consider implementing server-side CSP headers through .htaccess or server configuration if security controls are still desired but with more flexibility than the meta tag approach.

3. Update any documentation that previously referred to the CSP implementation.
