## Files Kept Separate
The following CSS files were intentionally kept separate:
- style.css - Main stylesheet with core styling
- responsive.css - All media queries for responsive design
- semantic-styles.css - Foundational semantic styling
- fontawesome/ directory - External font library

## HTML Updates
All HTML files have been updated to reference the new consolidated CSS files instead of the individual files.

## Original Files
Original CSS files have been archived in the `/css_archive/` directory for reference.

## Testing
- All pages have been verified to use the correct consolidated CSS files.
- No references to old CSS files remain in the HTML.

## Benefits
1. Reduced HTTP requests from 19+ CSS files to just 9 files
2. Improved organization of CSS code by logical function
3. Better maintainability with related styles grouped together
4. Preserved separation of concerns for major functional areas

## Next Steps
1. Conduct visual testing on all pages to ensure styling is preserved
2. Consider further optimizations like CSS minification
3. Update developer documentation to reflect the new CSS structure
