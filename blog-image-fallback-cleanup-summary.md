# Blog Image and Fallback Script Cleanup

## Changes Made

1. **Removed image-fallback.js script from blog.html**
   - Eliminated the unnecessary fallback script that was causing performance issues
   - Ensured that blog images load correctly without fallbacks

2. **Removed image-fallback.js references from all blog post files**
   - Created and executed a script to remove fallback references from all blog post pages
   - Updated templates to ensure new blog posts won't include fallback scripts

3. **Updated Dockerfile to remove image-fallback.js references**
   - Removed lines that add the fallback script to HTML files during build
   - Ensures clean builds without unnecessary fallback scripts

4. **Updated package.json to remove image-fallback.js minification task**
   - Streamlined the build process by removing minification of the removed script
   - Ensures that no reference to the fallback script remains in the build process

5. **Verified blog images are correctly referenced**
   - Checked that blog image paths are correct across all blog pages
   - Confirmed that all required images exist in the assets directory
   - Identified and maintained intentionally used placeholder images

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduced JavaScript overhead by removing unnecessary code
   - Eliminated potential script errors and browser crashes

2. **Cleaner Codebase**
   - Removed deprecated functionality that was no longer needed
   - Simplified HTML structure in blog pages

3. **Better Image Loading**
   - Images now load naturally without relying on fallback mechanisms
   - Proper image paths ensure correct display across the site

## Conclusion

The image fallback script has been completely removed from all blog-related files, and blog images are now correctly referenced with proper paths. All image files referenced in the blogs exist in the appropriate directories, ensuring that the blog pages display properly without unnecessarily loading fallback images. The few placeholder images that remain are intentional and used appropriately where actual images are not yet available.
