# Fabric & Wood Integration Theme Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented the "Dark Felt Body + Wood Elements & Tint" theme throughout the Evolve Acoustics website, creating a cohesive and professional aesthetic that enhances the audio focus of the brand.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Base Theme
- Applied dark charcoal felt background (#383838) with subtle noise texture
- Added mahogany wood grain overlay with color-burn blend mode (opacity: 0.1)
- Enhanced header and footer with substantial wood grain appearance and defined borders

### 2. Wood Accent Panels
- Created versatile wood-accent-panel component system with multiple variations:
  - Default: Standard wood panel with dark overlay
  - Light: Less opaque overlay for a brighter appearance
  - Dark: More opaque overlay for dramatic contrast
  - Decorated: Double borders and enhanced styling
- Added wood-accent-divider for elegant section separation

### 3. Page-Specific Enhancements
- **Homepage**: Enhanced hero section and services with wood panels
- **About Us Page**: Applied wood panels to key content sections
- **Contact Page**: Enhanced contact methods and form with wood styling
- **Gallery Page**: Added decorated panel for introduction
- **Blog Page**: Applied wood theme to header and filters
- **Services Pages**: Enhanced content sections with wood panels

### 4. Interactive Elements
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Redesigned with rich wood textures and subtle animation
- **Mobile Menu**: Enhanced with wood background and improved interaction states
- **Preloader**: Updated with fabric and wood integration

## Wood Accent Panel Usage
The wood-accent-panel system provides a versatile way to highlight important content:
- Use `.wood-accent-panel` for standard panels
- Add `.light`, `.dark`, or `.decorated` modifiers for variations
- Use `.wood-accent-divider` for horizontal section separators

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding wood panel styling to testimonials page
2. Review and fine-tune responsiveness on mobile devices
3. Optimize image loading for the wood textures
4. Apply consistent wood accent styling to form elements
5. Consider adding subtle wood grain texture to buttons

## Performance Considerations
The wood grain textures add visual richness but require careful optimization:
- `mahogany_texture.webp` is used throughout the site
- Keep overlay opacity low (0.1-0.15) for subtle effects
- Use background-blend-mode for texture variation without additional images

This implementation successfully integrates fabric and wood textures to create a cohesive, professional aesthetic that aligns with Evolve Acoustics' brand identity as a premium acoustic solutions provider.
