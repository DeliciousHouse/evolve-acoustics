# Blog Card CSS Cleanup Summary

## Overview
We've cleaned up redundant and conflicting CSS rules in the blog.css file to ensure consistent blog card display without relying on the problematic JavaScript files that were previously removed. The cleanup focused on removing duplicated styles and consolidating all blog card styling in the "FINAL BLOG CARD FIX" section at the end of the file.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed the first `.blog-card` definition block**
   - Removed duplicated styles for `.blog-card`, `.blog-card-image`, `.blog-card-content`, `.blog-card h2`, and `.blog-card p` that appeared near the top of the file
   - These styles were causing conflicts with the final, more comprehensive styles
   - Replaced with a comment referencing the FINAL BLOG CARD FIX section

2. **Removed scattered `.blog-card-content` rules**
   - Removed conflicting overflow properties for the card content container
   - These were causing text to display inconsistently

3. **Removed duplicate `.blog-card-image` styles**
   - Removed redundant image container and img styling rules
   - These were creating conflicts with the final, more comprehensive image styling

4. **Removed commented-out "CRITICAL FIX" sections**
   - Removed both the "PREVIOUS CRITICAL FIX" section and another "CRITICAL FIX" section that were commented out
   - These sections contained old approaches to fixing the blog card display issues that are no longer needed

5. **Cleaned up random characters and typos**
   - Removed non-CSS text like "hgtyq U7" that appeared in the file

## Result
The blog.css file now has:
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- No redundant style definitions
- All blog card styling consolidated in the "FINAL BLOG CARD FIX" section
- Better organization with clear comments
- Consistent styling across different screen sizes

These changes complement the removal of the problematic JavaScript files and ensure that blog cards display correctly with proper image rendering and text truncation.
